CLI to embed (testable) snippets from your {python,other} codebases into your
`README.md`.

## What

What it does: Lets you make a `EXAMPLE.md` template and include snippets from
your (working and tested) python codebase.

Turn this (`snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2`):

<!---->
```md
# A README

Here is a code snippet:

`{{ pysnippet(path='snipinator/examples/code.py', symbol='MyClass', backtickify='py') }}`

```
<!---->

Into this (`snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.generated.md`):

<!---->
`````md
<!--

-->
# A README

Here is a code snippet:

````py
class MyClass:
  """This is a global class"""

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def MyClassMethod(self):
    """This is a method of MyClass"""
    print(self.name)
````

`````
<!---->

## Features

- Supports anything Jinja2 supports.
- First class support for python source code.
  - Can include python function signatures, docstrings, entire function source
    code, classes.
- Supports any language.
  - With delimiter markers, or inclusion of the entire file.
- Can include shell output.
  - Supports ANSI colors with SVG output.
- More robust references/links to local files using `path()`.
- First class support for markdown output (with backtickify, decomentify).

## Installation

```bash
# Install from pypi (https://pypi.org/project/snipinator/)
pip install snipinator

# Install from git (https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator)
pip install git+https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator.git@v1.2.0
```

## Usage

Example template README:
[`snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2`](./snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2):

<!---->
```md
# A README

Here is a code snippet:

`{{ pysnippet(path='snipinator/examples/code.py', symbol='MyClass', backtickify='py') }}`

```
<!---->

Generating the README:

<!---->
`````bash
$ python -m snipinator.cli -t snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2

## Requirements

- Linux-like environment
  - Why: Uses pexpect.spawn().
- Python 3.8+
  - Why: Some dev dependencies require Python 3.8+.

## Tested on

- WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8.0
- Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8.0, 3.9.0, 3.10.0, 3.11.0, 3.12.0, tested in GitHub
  Actions workflow
  ([build-and-test.yml](./.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml)).

## Gotchas and Limitations

- **Security:** This tool is NOT designed to be used with untrusted input. It is
  designed to be used with your own codebase. Even when using your own input, be
  careful that your own code won't be doing anything that might inadvertently
  include untrusted input.
- Be careful to escape `{{` and `}}`,
  or `{%` and `%}` or anything jinja2
  is sensitive to, in the templates. You'll have to escape it properly for
  jinja2, which involves using `{% raw %}` and
  `{% endraw %}` tags.
- Recursion: Snipinator doesn't directly support recursive inclusion of
  generated content. You can generate the contents of one file first, and
  include that generated content into another template. This would mean that you
  have to worry about order of generation.
- Embedded Backticks: If there are backticks in the included snippet, it might
  ruin the backticks you have in your markdown. This is why `backtickify`
  parameter exists in the API, so that Snipinator provides the backticks, and it
  will detect if there are backticks in the snippet and use a different number
  of backticks on the entire snippet. So if the snippet contains
  ` ```My Snippet``` `, Snipinator will use
  ` ````language ```My Snippet``` ```` ` and this is a method that Markdown uses
  to allow embedded backticks inside a code block.
- Formatting: The `{{` `}}` used to
  surround the snippet calls will unfortunately be formatted by a Markdown
  formatter and make the call invalid. Workarounds:
  - **Decommentify**: Put the snippet call inside a HTML comment, then use
    `decommentify` parameter. See
    [`snipinator/examples/LONG-EXAMPLE.md.jinja2`](./snipinator/examples/LONG-EXAMPLE.md.jinja2)
    for examples.
  - [prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatter is pretty good at leaving the
    Jinja2 calls alone, especially if you don't have any spaces. This especially
    helps for markdown "reference-style links" that have Jinja2 calls in them
    generating part of the URL, mdformat will URL encode the Jinja2 calls,
    and/or split them on spaces, which is not what we want. prettier will leave
    them alone.
  - For code blocks: If you embed the snippet call in a code block, it will not
    be formatted. However, because of **Embedded Backticks** gotcha, (see
    above), this is not recommended, unless you know for sure that there are no
    embedded backticks.
  - If your formatter supports a comment that disabled formatting, you can
    surround the snippet call with that comment.
- Editing the wrong file: When you have a template and a generated file, it is
  easy to edit the wrong file. To combat this:
  - Snipinator provides a warning at the top of the generated file to remind you
    that it is auto-generated.
  - Snipinator will optionally chmod the file for you to make it read-only.
- Newlines: This program assumes LF newlines. I don't know if it will work for
  anything else.
- Combining `backtickify` and `indent`: Doesn't make much sense, but if you do
  it, it will run backtickify first, then indent everything including the
  backticks.

## Contributions

### Development environment: Linux-like

- For running `pre.sh` (Linux-like environment).
  - Requires `pyenv`, or an exact matching version of python as in
    `.python-version` (which is currently
    `3.8.0
`).
  - `jq`, ([installation](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)) required for
    [yq](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq), which is itself required for our
    `README.md` generation, which uses `tomlq` (from the
    [yq](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) package) to include version strings from
    `pyproject.toml`.
  - `bash`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed` `xxd`, `git`, `xxhash` (for tests/workflows).
  - Requires nodejs (for act).
  - Requires Go (to run act).
  - docker (for act).

### Commit Process

1. (Optionally) Fork the `develop` branch.
2. Stage your files: `git add path/to/file.py`.
3. `bash scripts/pre.sh`, this will format, lint, and test the code.
4. `git status` check if anything changed (generated `README.md` for
   example), if so, `git add` the changes, and go back to the previous step.
5. `git commit -m "..."`.
6. Make a PR to `develop` (or push to develop if you have the rights).

## Release Process

These instructions are for maintainers of the project.

1. In the `develop` branch, run `bash scripts/pre.sh` to ensure
   everything is in order.
2. In the `develop` branch, bump the version in `pyproject.toml`,
   following semantic versioning principles. Also modify the
   `last_unstable_release` and `last_stable_release` in the
   `[tool.changeguard-project-metadata]` table as appropriate. Run
   `bash scripts/pre.sh` to ensure everything is in order.
3. In the `develop` branch, commit these changes with a message like
   `"Prepare release X.Y.Z"`. (See the contributions section
   [above](#commit-process)).
4. Merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch:
   `git checkout master && git merge develop --no-ff`.
5. `master` branch: Tag the release: Create a git tag for the release with
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"`.
6. Publish to PyPI: Publish the release to PyPI with
   `bash scripts/deploy-to-pypi.sh`.
7. Push to GitHub: Push the commit and tags to GitHub with
   `git push && git push --tags`.
8. The `--no-ff` option adds a commit to the master branch for the merge, so
   refork the develop branch from the master branch:
   `git checkout develop && git merge master`.
9. Push the develop branch to GitHub: `git push origin develop`.

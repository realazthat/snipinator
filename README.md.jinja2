# Snipinator

Make your `README.md` into a Jinja2 template for including snippets from your
python codebase. Uses Jinja2, and Python's AST library.

## What

What it does: Lets you make a `EXAMPLE.md` template and include snippets from
your (working and tested) python codebase.

Turn this (`{{ path('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2') }}`):

`{{ rawsnippet('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2', backtickify='md') }}`

Into this (`{{ path('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.generated.jinja2') }}`):

`{{ rawsnippet('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.generated.md', backtickify='md') }}`

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# Install from git (https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator)
pip install git+https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator.git
```

### Use

`{{ rawsnippet('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2', backtickify='md') }}`

## Available Functions in Jinja2

`{{ pysignature(path='snipinator/snipinate.py', symbol='pysnippet', backtickify='py') }}`
`{{ pysignature(path='snipinator/snipinate.py', symbol='pysignature', backtickify='py') }}`
`{{ pysignature(path='snipinator/snipinate.py', symbol='rawsnippet', backtickify='py') }}`
`{{ pysignature(path='snipinator/snipinate.py', symbol='snippet', backtickify='py') }}`

## Gotchas

- **Security:** This tool is not designed to be used with untrusted input. It is
  designed to be used with your own codebase. Even so, be careful that your own
  code won't be doing weird things.
- Be careful to escape `{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`,
  or `{% raw %}{%{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}%}{% endraw %}` or anything jinja2
  is sensitive to, in the templates. You'll have to escape it properly.
- Recursion: Snipinator doesn't directly support recursive inclusion of
  generated content. You can generate the contents of one file first, and
  include that generated content into another template. This would mean that you
  have to worry about order of generation.
- Embedded Backticks: If there are backticks in the included snippet, it might
  ruin the backticks you have in your markdown. This is why `backtickify`
  parameter exists in the API, so that Snipinator provides the backticks, and it
  will detect if there are backticks in the snippet and use a different number
  of backticks on the entire snippet. So if the snippet contains
  ```` ```My Snippet``` ````, Snipinator will use
  ````` ````language ```My Snippet``` ```` ````` and this is a method that
  Markdown uses to allow embedded backticks inside a code block.
- Formatting: The `{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}` used to
  surround the snippet calls will unfortunately be formatted by a Markdown
  formatter and make the call invalid. Workarounds:
  - For code blocks: If you embed the snippet call in a code block, it will not
    be formatted. However, because of **Embedded Backticks** gotcha, (see
    above), this is not recommended, unless you know for sure that there are no
    embedded backticks.
  - If your formatter supports a comment that disabled formatting, you can
    surround the snippet call with that comment.
- Editing the wrong file: When you have a template and a generated file, it is
  easy to edit the wrong file. To combat this:
  - Snipinator provides a warning at the top of the generated file to remind you
    that it is auto-generated.
  - Snipinator will optionally chmod the file for you to make it read-only.
- Newlines: This program assumes LF newlines. I don't know if it will work for
  anything else.
- Combining `backtickify` and `indent`: Doesn't make much sense, but if you do
  it, it will run backtickify first, then indent everything including the
  backticks.

# Snipinator

## What

What it does: Lets you make a `EXAMPLE.md` template and include snippets from
your (working and tested) python codebase.

Turn this (`snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2`):

{{ rawsnippet('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.md.jinja2', backtickify='md') }}

Into this (`snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.generated.md`):

{{ rawsnippet('snipinator/examples/EXAMPLE.generated.md', backtickify='md') }}

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# Install from git (https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator)
pip install git+https://github.com/realazthat/snipinator.git
```

### Use

## Jinja2 Functions

## Gotchas

- Be careful to escape `\{\{` and `\}\}`, or `\{\%` and `\%\}` or anything
  jinja2 is sensitive to, in the templates. You'll have to escape it properly.
- **Security:** This tool is not designed to be used with untrusted input. It is
  designed to be used with your own codebase. Even so, be careful that your own
  code won't be doing weird things.

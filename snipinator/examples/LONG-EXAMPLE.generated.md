Here is a code snippet (global class):

````py
class MyClass:
  """This is a global class"""

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def MyClassMethod(self):
    """This is a method of MyClass"""
    print(self.name)
````

Here is a code snippet (class member method):

````py
  def MyClassMethod(self):
    """This is a method of MyClass"""
    print(self.name)
````

Same thing but just the signature:

````py
  def MyClassMethod(self):
    """This is a method of MyClass"""
````

Here is a code snippet (global method):

````py
async def GlobalMethod():
  """This is a global method"""
  print('Hello')
````
